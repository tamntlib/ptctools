# V1Lifecycle


## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**post_start** | [**V1LifecycleHandler**](V1LifecycleHandler.md) | PostStart is called immediately after a container is created. If the handler fails, the container is terminated and restarted according to its restart policy. Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks +optional | [optional] 
**pre_stop** | [**V1LifecycleHandler**](V1LifecycleHandler.md) | PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure, preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the container crashes or exits. The Pod&#39;s termination grace period countdown begins before the PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the container will eventually terminate within the Pod&#39;s termination grace period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes or until the termination grace period is reached. More info: https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/#container-hooks +optional | [optional] 
**stop_signal** | [**V1Signal**](V1Signal.md) | StopSignal defines which signal will be sent to a container when it is being stopped. If not specified, the default is defined by the container runtime in use. StopSignal can only be set for Pods with a non-empty .spec.os.name +optional | [optional] 

## Example

```python
from openapi_client.models.v1_lifecycle import V1Lifecycle

# TODO update the JSON string below
json = "{}"
# create an instance of V1Lifecycle from a JSON string
v1_lifecycle_instance = V1Lifecycle.from_json(json)
# print the JSON string representation of the object
print(V1Lifecycle.to_json())

# convert the object into a dict
v1_lifecycle_dict = v1_lifecycle_instance.to_dict()
# create an instance of V1Lifecycle from a dict
v1_lifecycle_from_dict = V1Lifecycle.from_dict(v1_lifecycle_dict)
